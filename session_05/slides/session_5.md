# For Loops

```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

for person in names:
    print(person)

# Alice
# Bob
# Charlie
```

---

# For Loops

```python
# Create variables to store our numbers and counts
numbers = [1, 10, 13 , 15, 765, 32, 65, 23, 56, 101]
even_count = 0
odd_count = 0

# Loop through all our numbers
for i in numbers:
    # Check to see if the number is odd/even
    if i % 2 == 0:
        even_count = even_count + 1
    else:
        # This is short hand for the line above
        odd_count += 1

print("Even: " + str(even_count))
print("Odd: " + str(odd_count))
```

---

# For Loops

```python
for letter in "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious":
    print(letter.upper())
```

---

# For Loops

```python
# All vowels in lowercase
vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]

# Make the word lowercase and then loop through each letter
for letter in "supeRcaliFragiListiCexPiaLidOcIous".lower():
    # Check to see if the lowercase letter matches a vowel
    if letter in vowels:
        print(letter.upper())
    else:
        print(letter.lower())
```

---

# Ranges

```python
range(10)
#[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

range(1, 5)
#[1, 2, 3, 4]

range(2000, 2020, 4)
#[2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016]
```

---

# For Loops

```python
for olympic_years in range(1896, 2020, 4):
    print(olympic_years)

# ...
# 2008
# 2012
# 2016
```

---

# For Loops

```python
# Do something 3 times
for x in range(3):
    print(input("What is your name? "))
```

---

# For Loops

```python
times_to_ask = int(input("How many times should I ask? "))

for x in range(times_to_ask):
    print(input("What is your name? "))
```
