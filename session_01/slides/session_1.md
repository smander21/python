---

# Naming Python Files

- Lowercase
- Underscore instead of spaces
- No punctuation

---

# Hello, world!

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

---

# Variables

---

# Variables

```python
<variable_name> = <value>
```

---

# Variables

```python
name = "Charlie"
age = 27
left_to_pay = 29.99
has_paid = False
```

---

# Variables

- Any mix of letters, numbers and some special characters
- Must start with a letter
- Keep lowercase
- Use underscore where there are spaces

---

# Writing Python

- You are not writing an essay...
- Keep things lowercase
- Don't use punctuation
- Replace spaces with underscores

---

# Data Types

---

# Strings

---

# Strings

Characters surrounded by quotes

```python
name = "Alice"
address = "123 Station Road"
favourite_food = "Pizza"
```

---

# Escaping

---

# Escaping

```
\n = New line
\t = Tab
\" = Double Quote
```

---
# Escaping

```python
favourite_food = "Pizza from \"Dough N' Sauce\""
shopping_list = "Apples\nBread\nMilk\nEggs"
```
