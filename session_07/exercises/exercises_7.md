# Session 7 Exercises
## Section A
1. Write a function that prints your name
2. Write a function that accepts a name as a parameter and prints "Hello, <name>"
3. Loop through the list ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"] and call the function you just wrote
4. Write a function that prints the area of two passed in parameters
5. Write a function called 'print_list' that accepts a list as a parameter and then prints out each item of the list
6. Put the following into a function that accepts age as a parameter:
    1. If they are younger than 11, print "You're too young to go to this school"

## Section B
1. Write a function called is_odd that will return True or False if the integer passed as a parameter is odd (hint: x % 2 will return true for all odd numbers)
2. Write a function that accepts a word and returns it backwards, e.g. 'hello' -> 'olleh'
3. Write a recursive function that accepts a number and prints that number of stars, followed by ever decreasing stars on each line, E.g:
```
*****
****
***
**
*
```
4. Create a padlock function. You need to be able to pass in a passcode and if its correct it should return "Unlock", else "Locked"
5. Write a function that returns the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 between 0 and limit (parameter). For example, if limit is 20, it should return the sum of 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20
6. Write a function called is_prime() that accepts a number and return True or False if the number of prime or not
7. Write a function that checks to see if a string is a pallindrome, if it is, it will return True and False if it is not.
8. Write a function that checks to see if a sentence is a pallindrome, if it is, it will return True and False if it is not. Tip - you may want to format your sentence so it is all lower case, and .replace() to get rid of white spaces.
