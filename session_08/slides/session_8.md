# Modules

```python
import random
from math import floor
```

---

# Random Module

```python
import random

# Random float from 0.0 to 1.0
print random.random()

# Gets a random number between 1 and 10
number = random.randint(1, 10)
```

---

# Math Module

```python
from math import floor, ceil

number = floor(3.2) # 3
print(floor(9.99)) # 9

number = ceil(3.2) # 4
print(ceil(9.99)) # 10
```

---

# For Loops

```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

for person in names:
    print(person)

# Alice
# Bob
# Charlie
```

---

# While Loops

```python
guess = None
while guess != 4:
    # Continues to ask for a number until you enter 4
    guess = int(input("What's your number? "))
```

---

# Infinite Loops

```python
while True:
    # This loops forever
    print("Hello")
```

---

# Break Statements

```python
while True:
    print("Hello")
    break
```

---

# While Vs For Loop

```python
x = 1
while x <= 100:
    print(x)
    x += 1

for y in range(1, 101):
    print(y)
```

---

# Collections

- List
- Tuple
- Set
- Dictionary

---

# Collections — List

```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

names.append("Dave") # ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Dave"]

names[2] = "Chris" # ["Alice", "Bob", "Chris", "Dave"]

del(names[1])# ["Alice", "Chris", "Dave"]

if "Eve" in names:
    print("Eve is here")

for name in names:
    print(name)
```

---

# Collections — Tuple

```python
colours = ("Red", "Blue", "Green")
print(colours[0]) # Red
print(colours[1]) # Blue
print(colours[2]) # Green
```

---

# Collections — Set

```python
fruit = {"Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"}
for item in fruit:
    print(item)
```

---

# Collections — Dictionary

```python
shirt = {
    "size": "Large",
    "colour": "Red"
}

print(shirt["size"]) # Large

shirt["material"] = "Cotton" # Add new key/value pair
shirt["colour"] = "Green" # Change existing value

del(shirt["size"]) # Delete key/value pair

if "material" in shirt:
    print("The material is: " + shirt["material"])

for key in shirt:
    print(str(key) + " = " + str(shirt[key]))
```

---

# Nested Collections

```python
phone_grid = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9],
    ["*", 0, "#"]
]

for row in phone_grid:
    for column in row:
        print(column)
```

---

# List of Dictionaries

```python
contacts = [
    {"fname": "Alice", "lname": "Smith"},
    {"fname": "Bob", "lname": "Jones", "phone": "555-1234"},
    {"fname": "Charlie", "lname": "McCloud"}
]

for person in contacts:
    if "phone" in person:
        print(person["fname"])
```

---

# Functions

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello World!")

hello_world()
```

---

# Functions — Parameters

```python
def hello(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

hello("Alice")
hello("Bob")
hello("Charlie")
```

---

# Keeping it DRY

```python
def hello(name):
    print("Good Morning, " + name)

names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
for name in names:
    # If we ever want to call a different function we only have to change one line
    hello(name)
```

---

# Functions — Parameters

```python
def hello(name, age):
    print("Hello my name is " + name)
    print("I'm " + str(age) + " years old")

    age_in_10_years = age + 10
    print("In 10 years time I will be " + str(age_in_10_years))

hello("Alice", 22)
hello("Bob", 34)
hello("Charlie", 17)
```

---

# Functions — Parameters

```python
def volume(x, y, z):
    print("The volume is " + str(x * y * z))

volume(12, 3, 4)
volume(6, 14, 10)
```

---

# Functions — Returning

```python
def volume(x, y, z):
    return x * y * z

cube1 = volume(12, 3, 4)
cube2 = volume(6, 14, 10)
```

---

# Functions — Recursion

```python
def calc_factorial(x):
    if x == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return (x * calc_factorial(x - 1))

# calc_factorial(4)              # 1st call with 4
# 4 * calc_factorial(3)          # 2nd call with 3
# 4 * 3 * calc_factorial(2)      # 3rd call with 2
# 4 * 3 * 2 * calc_factorial(1)  # 4th call with 1
# 4 * 3 * 2 * 1                  # return from 4th call as number=1
# 4 * 3 * 2                      # return from 3rd call
# 4 * 6                          # return from 2nd call
# 24                             # return from 1st call
```

# Files — Handling

| Value |  Action | Description |
|--- | --- | --- |
| "r" | Read | Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist
| "a" | Append | Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
| "w" | Write | Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
| "x" | Create | Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

---

# Files — Write

```python
f = open("example.txt", "w")
f.write("Hello World")
f.close()
```

---

# Files — Write

```python
f = open("example.txt", "w")
f.write("Hello World")
f.close()

f = open("example.txt", "a")
f.write("It's nice to be here")
f.close()
```

---

# Files — Write

```python
f = open("names.txt", "a")

name = True
while name:
    name = input("Enter a name: ")
    f.write(name + "\n")

f.close()
```
