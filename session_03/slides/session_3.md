# Concatenation

```python
first_name = "Bob"
last_name = "Jones"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

print("Hello " + first_name)
print("Good morning, " + full_name)
```

---

# Comments
```python
# The total including VAT
total = sub_total + vat

has_paid = False # If the user has paid or not
```

---

# Casting

```python
x = int(8.3)  # x will be 8
y = float(9)  # y will be 9.0
z = str(10.0) # z will be '10.0'
```

# Index

| C | H | A | R | L | I | E |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| -7 | -6 | -5 | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 |


```python
name = "CHARLIE"
print(name[0]) # Prints 'C' - first index item
print(name[1]) # Prints 'H'
print(name[-1]) # Prints 'E' - last index item
```

# Input

```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("Hello " + name)

age = int(input("How old are you? "))
age_in_10_years = age + 10
print("In 10 years you will be " + str(age_in_10_years))
